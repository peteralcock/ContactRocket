Next-generation lead-generation software-as-a-service

## Introduction
This is a project I obsessed over for a couple years, which I ultimately failed to launch. It has sat on my external hard-drive "mountain" for years and now that I am on the hunt for a new RoR-heavy role, I figured I may as well just give it away and sacrifice my monetization pipedream as to make an open-source contribution to express my gratitude for Ruby on Rails, GitHub, and the internet as a whole. Gladiators, I salute you.

## Quick Start
I can't believe how long I've been using Docker, apparently I dockerized this whole thing. So getting started should be easy, if you know Docker.
