## Introduction
This is a project I obsessed over for a couple years, several years ago, for which I lost countless hours of sleep, but ultimately failed to launch as a SaaS product (marketing is expensive). It has sat uncelebrated on my external hard-drive "mountain" for over seven years, and since I am on the hunt for a new RoR-heavy technical role, figured I may as well just give it away and sacrifice a monetization pipedream to make an open-source contribution as an expression my gratitude for Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq (<a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/">Mike Perham</a>, you're the fucking man.) GitHub, Amazon Web Services, and the internet. Thanks to all of you corporate and human entities, my life-long love for software has been all the more enjoyable. <b>Gladiators, I salute you.</b>

## Quick Start
Wow I can't believe how long I've been using Docker... so I totally forgot how much infrastructure code I put into this project. I have dockerized this whole thing, into a few services. CRM, Web, and the Engine(s). If you know Docker and Rails, you should be fine. If you don't, watch my screencast found after this promotional explainer video I made in order to advertise this product on social media. Enjoy!
